    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Clone of a Cinnabon</strong>is just an alternative way to make <em>Cinnabon rolls</em> to be honest, 
    nothing is different it just cutting cost if you can't  buy it.And you get to learn something new but its still 
    tastes good and doesn't need to taste better .I would say it's  <strong>BANG FOR THE BUCK</strong>.</p>
