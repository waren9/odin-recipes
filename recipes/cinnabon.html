    <h3>Description:</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Clone of a Cinnabon</strong>is just an alternative way to make <em>Cinnabon rolls</em> to be honest, 
    nothing is different it just cutting cost if you can't  buy it.And you get to learn something new but its still 
    tastes good and doesn't need to taste better .I would say it's  <strong>BANG FOR THE BUCK</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Prepare dough: Place milk, eggs, margarine, flour, salt, white sugar, 
            and yeast in the pan of a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. 
            Select dough cycle; press Start. 
        </li>

        <li>When dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. 
            Cover it with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes. 
        </li>

        <li>Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a 16x21-inch rectangle. </li>

        <li>Prepare filling: Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. 
            Spread softened butter over the dough, then sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over top. 
        </li>
        <li>Starting at the longer end, roll up the dough; cut into 12 rolls. 
            Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking pan. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, 
            about 30 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Spread icing on warm rolls before serving. </li>
